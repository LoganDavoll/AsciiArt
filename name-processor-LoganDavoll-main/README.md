# Name Processor

In this practice, you will develop a java program that processes a name entered by the user. The program does the following: 

- It reads the user's first and last name (read an entire line as a single string - already done for you)
- Prints the last name, followed by a comma and the first initial, followed by a period. 
- Assume that the user types a valid name.

### Method
- Extract the first initial and last name from the name entered by the user (fullName)
- use the methods of the String class to manipulate the fullName as specified
- display the results to the console

### Expected Output:

*Type your name: Matt Geiger*  
*4*  
*Your name is: Geiger, M.*  

### Hint:
_*Where did that 4 come from?*_
